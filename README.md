# TikTok Exploit

There's currently a TikTok exploit going around that, when abused properly, allows you to "impersonate" TikTok accounts on platforms that allow you to connect TikTok acounts, such as [Discord](https://discord.com).

I am simply publishing the source-code to the exploit, as a lot of individuals have been attempting to sell this exploit for money.

**Note: I have made a few modifications to how the headers are generated, as I had issues with the original source-code. However the exploit is still somewhat unreliable.**

To "activate" the exploit, you'll need:
- A VPN based in Saudi Arabia (UAE)
- EditThisCookie (Chrome Extension)
- Google Chrome (Edge/Chromium/Safari/FireFox all seem not to work correctly)
- An Outlook/Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail, or iCloud email account (tempmail/custom domains will not work)

First, you're going to open up Google Chrome and install the aforementioned EditThisCookie extension.

Then, turn on your UAE VPN (United States **might** work but it's less reliable for me personally).

Next, go to the [TikTok](https://tiktok.com) website, and signup using the aforementioned e-mail.

After you do, run the Python script in this repository.

When you run it, you're asked for a sessionid. You can grab this by using the EditThisCookie extension and copying the `sessionid` cookie. It should look similar to [this](https://i.imgur.com/PDCj4Mf.png).
Now, it will ask you for a username. Enter your desired username, add a bunch of spaces, and finally any random letter. An example would be: 
```
github                                                               x

```

If you did all the previous steps correctly, it should say it's been [sucessful](https://i.imgur.com/hiPdahb.png)! Now you can connect it to any Discord account (or whatever else allows you to connect a TikTok account) and it will appear as if you own that account!
